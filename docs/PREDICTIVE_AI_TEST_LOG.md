## Test Scenario: Burn Rate Simulation
*   **Target Item:** Creta
*   **Action:** Injected 100 units of "OUT" transactions over the last 30 days.
*   **Calculation:** Total Out (100) / 30 Days = 3.33 Units/Day.
*   **Prediction:** Current Stock (15) / 3.33 = 4.5 days (Floor to 4).

## Results
*   **Burn Rate Accuracy:** SUCCESS (3.33/day confirmed).
*   **Countdown Logic:** SUCCESS (4 days remaining confirmed).
*   **Priority Trigger:** SUCCESS (Correctly flagged as URGENT).
